                    <p>These systems use fans to remove stale air from areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms. They do not actively bring in fresh air from outside but rely on natural infiltration through cracks and openings.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Supply Ventilation Systems</h2>
                    <p>These systems bring fresh outdoor air into the home through fans and distribute it throughout the house. Stale air is simultaneously expelled through exhaust vents or natural leakage.</p>
                        <br>
                    <h2>Balanced Ventilation Systems</h2>
                    <p>These systems provide a balanced approach by bringing fresh air and exhausting stale air. They use fans to control airflow and ensure a balanced ventilation exchange.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV) Systems</h2>
                    <p>ERV systems are designed to improve energy efficiency by transferring heat and moisture from the outgoing air to the incoming air. This helps to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature while still exchanging fresh air.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How a Fresh Air Ventilation System Works</h2>
                    <p>A fresh air ventilation system brings fresh outdoor air into the home while removing stale indoor air. It typically consists of a network of ducts and vents strategically placed throughout the house. The system is equipped with filters to remove dust, pollen, and other airborne particles before the air enters the living spaces.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The ventilation system can be designed to operate passively, relying on natural airflow, or actively, using fans or blowers to facilitate the air exchange process. By continuously circulating fresh air, the system helps maintain optimal indoor air quality, regulates temperature and humidity levels, and promotes a healthier and more comfortable living environment.</p>
                    <br>
